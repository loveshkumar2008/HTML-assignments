<h1>Images</h1>
<p>There are many reasons why you might 
want to add an image to a web page: you 
might want to include a logo, photograph, 
illustration, diagram, or chart.
There are several things to consider when selecting and 
preparing images for your site, but taking time to get them 
right will make it look more attractive and professional.
In this chapter you will learn how to:<br/><ul>
<li> Include an image in your web pages using HTML</li>
<li>Pick which image format to use</li>
<li>Show an image at the right size</li>
<li>Optimize an image for use on the web to make pages 
load faster</li></p>
<h2>Adding Images</h2>
<p>To add an image into the page 
you need to use an img
element. This is an empty 
element (which means there is 
no closing tag). It must carry the 
following two attributes:
<br/><h4>src</h4>
This tells the browser where 
it can find the image file. This 
will usually be a relative URL 
pointing to an image on your 
own site. (Here you can see that 
the images are in a child folder 
called images — relative URLs 
were covered on pages 83-84). 
<br/><h4>alt</h4>

This provides a text description 
of the image which describes the 
image if you cannot see it.
<br/><h4>title</h4>

You can also use the title
attribute with the img element 
to provide additional information 
about the image. Most browsers 
will display the content of this 
attribute in a tootip when the 
user hovers over the image.example:<br/><img src="C:\Users\LENOVO\Desktop\codenetic 2\pages\IMG_2183.jpg" height="600" width="390" alt="here is a painting's picture made by lovesh.arts" title="For such more paintings follow at lovesh.arts@instagram.com"/></p>
<h2>Height & Width
 of Images</h2>
<p>You will also often see an img
element use two other attributes 
that specify its size:
height
This specifies the height of the 
image in pixels.
width
This specifies the width of the 
image in pixels.
Images often take longer to 
load than the HTML code that 
makes up the rest of the page. 
It is, therefore, a good idea to 
specify the size of the image 
so that the browser can render 
the rest of the text on the page 
while leaving the right amount of 
space for the image that is still 
loading.
The size of images is increasingly 
being specified using CSS rather 
than HTML — see pages 409-
410 for more information about 
this. example:<br/><img src="C:\Users\LENOVO\Desktop\codenetic 2\pages\IMG_2192.jpg" height="300" width="230"/> <img src="C:\Users\LENOVO\Desktop\codenetic 2\pages\IMG_2192.jpg" height="250" width="200"/> <img src="C:\Users\LENOVO\Desktop\codenetic 2\pages\IMG_2192.jpg" height="200" width="170"/></p>
<h2>Where to Place Images 
in Your Code</h2>
<p>Where an image is placed 
in the code will affect how it 
is displayed. Here are three 
examples of image placement 
that produce different results:<dl><dt> <b>before a paragraph</b></dt>
<dd>The paragraph starts on a new 
line after the image.</dd><br/><img src="C:\Users\LENOVO\Desktop\codenetic 2\pages\moreno on Twitter.jfif" height="250" width="150"/><p>Being lonely can be painful.<br/> It causes the heart to sting <br>But physically being alone <br/>Isn't always the same thing.</p>
<dt><b> inside the start of a 
paragraph</b></dt><dd>
The first row of text aligns with 
the bottom of the image.</dd><br/><p><img src="C:\Users\LENOVO\Desktop\codenetic 2\pages\moreno on Twitter.jfif" height="250" width="150"/>Being lonely can be painful.<br/> It causes the heart to sting <br>But physically being alone <br/>Isn't always the same thing.</p>
<dt><b>in the middle of a 
paragraph</b></dt><dd>
The image is placed between the 
words of the paragraph that it 
appears in.</dd><p>Being lonely <img src="C:\Users\LENOVO\Desktop\codenetic 2\pages\moreno on Twitter.jfif" height="250" width="150"/> can be painful.<br/> It causes the heart to sting <br>But physically being alone <br/>Isn't always the same thing.</p>
</p></p>
<h2>Old Code: Aligning 
Images Horizontally
</h2>
<p>The align attribute was 
commonly used to indicate how 
the other parts of a page should 
flow around an image. It has 
been removed from HTML5 
and new websites should use 
CSS to control the alignment of 
images (as you will see on pages 
411-412). 
I have discussed it here because 
you are likely to come across 
it if you look at older code, and 
because some visual editors still 
insert this attribute when you 
indicate how an image should be 
aligned.
The align attribute can take 
these horizontal values:<br/>
<b>Left</b><br/>
This aligns the image to the left 
(allowing text to flow around its 
right-hand side).<br/><img src="C:\Users\LENOVO\Desktop\codenetic 2\pages\WhatsApp Image 2024-04-18 at 1.34.33 PM.jpeg" align="left" height="300" width="300"/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<b>Right</b><br/>
This aligns the image to the right 
(allowing text to flow around its 
left-hand side).<br/><img src="C:\Users\LENOVO\Desktop\codenetic 2\pages\WhatsApp Image 2024-04-18 at 1.34.33 PM.jpeg" align="right" height="300" width="300"/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

<h2>Old Code: Aligning 
Images Vertically</h2>
<p>As you saw on the last page, the 
align attribute is no longer used 
in HTML5, but it is covered here 
because you may see it used in 
older websites and it is still used 
in the code created by some 
visual editors.
You can see how to use CSS 
to achieve the same effects on 
pages 285-286.
There are three values that the 
align attribute can take that 
control how the image should 
align vertically with the text that 
surrounds it:
<br/><b>top</b><br/>
This aligns the first line of the 
surrounding text with the top of 
the image.<p><img src="C:\Users\LENOVO\Desktop\codenetic 2\pages\55e268ef-10b6-4654-b67c-b9012f4bbf11.jpg" align="top" height="270" width="170"/>This is the time of year when the days keep getting shorter and darker until the solstice finally arrives and the light begins ever so slowly its return. Light, and the return of it, is symbolic in myriad religious and cultural celebrations during the season. In addition to the winter solstice, there is the star that guided the shepherds by night in Bethlehem to witness the birth of Christ and brightly colored Christmas lights on houses and in trees. There is the lighting of the Hanukkah menorah, and fireworks and diyas during Diwali, the Hindu Festival of Lights.</p>
<br/><b>middle</b><br/>

This aligns the first line of the 
surrounding text with the middle 
of the image.<p><img src="C:\Users\LENOVO\Desktop\codenetic 2\pages\55e268ef-10b6-4654-b67c-b9012f4bbf11.jpg" align="middle" height="270" width="170"/>This is the time of year when the days keep getting shorter and darker until the solstice finally arrives and the light begins ever so slowly its return.

<br/><b>bottom</b><br/>

This aligns the first line of the 
surrounding text with the bottom 
of the image.<p><img src="C:\Users\LENOVO\Desktop\codenetic 2\pages\55e268ef-10b6-4654-b67c-b9012f4bbf11.jpg" align="bottom" height="270" width="170"/>This is the time of year when the days keep getting shorter and darker until the solstice finally arrives and the light begins ever so slowly its return.

<h2>Figure and 
Figure Caption
</h2><p>Images often come with 
captions. HTML5 has introduced 
a new figure element to 
contain images and their caption 
so that the two are associated. 
You can have more than one 
image inside the <figure>
element as long as they all share 
the same caption.
<figcaption>
The figcaption element has 
been added to HTML5 in order 
to allow web page authors to add 
a caption to an image.
Before these elements were 
created there was no way to 
associate an img element with 
its caption.
Older browsers that do not 
understand HTML5 elements 
simply ignore the new elements 
and display the content of them.used as bellow:</p>
<figure><img src="C:\Users\LENOVO\Desktop\codenetic 2\pages\By Daniel Van Der Putten holland festő_.jpg"
"C:\Users\LENOVO\Desktop\codenetic 2\pages\ENTARDECER.jpg"
"C:\Users\LENOVO\Desktop\codenetic 2\pages\Hessah art.jpg" /><figcaption>"Life's a climb. But the view is great." There are times when things seemingly go to plan, and there are other moments when nothing works out.<br/>

During those instances, you might feel lost. But words of encouragement can help. Certain quotes can inspire and remind you to live life to the fullest and persevere through whatever challenges come your way.</figcaption>
