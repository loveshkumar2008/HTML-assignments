<h1>Tables</h1>
<p>A table represents information in a grid format. 
Examples of tables include financial reports, TV 
schedules, and sports results.</p>
<h2>Basic Table Structure
</h2>
<p>The table element is used 
to create a table. The contents 
of the table are written out row 
by row.<br>

You indicate the start of each 
row using the opening tr tag. 
(The tr stands for table row.) 
It is followed by one or more 
td elements (one for each cell 
in that row). 
At the end of the row you use a 
closing /tr tag.
<td>
Each cell of a table is 
represented using a td
element. (The td stands for 
table data.)
At the end of each cell you use a 
closing /td tag.
Some browsers automatically 
draw lines around the table 
and/or the individual cells. You 
will learn how to control the 
borders of tables using CSS on 
pages 309-312 and 337-340.</p>
example:<table>
<tr><td>one</td><td>two</td><td>three</td></tr>
<tr><td>four</td><td>five</td><td>six</td></tr>
<tr><td>seven</td><td>eight</td><td>nine</td></tr>
</table>
<h2>Table headings</h2>
<p>The th element is used just 
like the td element but its 
purpose is to represent the 
heading for either a column or 
a row. (The th stands for table 
heading.) 
Even if a cell has no content, 
you should still use a td or 
th element to represent 
the presence of an empty cell 
otherwise the table will not 
render correctly. (The first cell 
in the first row of this example 
shows an empty cell.)
Using th elements for 
headings helps people who 
use screen readers, improves 
the ability for search engines 
to index your pages, and also 
enables you to control the 
appearance of tables better 
when you start to use CSS.
You can use the scope attribute 
on the th element to indicate 
whether it is a heading for a 
column or a row. It can take the 
values: row to indicate a heading 
for a row or col to indicate a 
heading for a column.
Browsers usually display the 
content of a th element in 
bold and in the middle of the cell.
example:<br/>
<table><tr><th></th><th scope="col">Monday</th>
<th scope="col">Tueasday</th><th scope="col">Wednesday</th><th scope="col">Thursday</th><th scope="col">Friday</th><th scope="col">Saturday</th><th scope="col">Sunday</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">1st:</th><td>English</td><td>English</td><td>English</td><td>English</td><td>English</td><td>English</td><td></td></tr>
</table><br/>
<h2>Spanning Columns</h2>
<p>Sometimes you may need the 
entries in a table to stretch 
across more than one column.
The colspan attribute can be 
used on a th or td element 
and indicates how many columns 
that cell should run across.
In the example on the right 
you can see a timetable with 
five columns; the first column 
contains the heading for that 
row (the day), the remaining four 
represent one hour time slots.
If you look at the table cell that 
contains the words 'Geography' 
you will see that the value of the 
colspan attribute is 2, which 
indicates that the cell should run 
across two columns. In the third 
row, 'Gym' runs across three 
columns.
You can see that the second 
and third rows have fewer 
td elements than there are 
columns. This is because, when 
a cell extends across more than 
one column, the td or th
cells that would have been in the 
place of the wider cells are not 
included in the code.
I added some CSS styles to this 
example so that you can see how 
the cells span more than one 
column. You will learn how to do 
this on pages 250, 337-340.</p>
<h2>Spanning rows</h2>
<p>You may also need entries in 
a table to stretch down across 
more than one row.
The rowspan attribute can be 
used on a <th> or td element 
to indicate how many rows a cell 
should span down the table.
In the example on the left you 
can see that ABC is showing a 
movie from 6pm - 8pm, whereas 
the BBC and CNN channels are 
both showing two programs 
during this time period (each of 
which lasts one hour).
If you look at the last tr
element, it only contains three 
elements even though there are 
four columns in the result below. 
This is because the movie in the 
tr element above it uses the 
rowspan attribute to stretch 
down and take over the cell 
below.
I have added some CSS styles to 
this example so that you can see 
how the cells span more than 
one row. You will learn how to 
apply these CSS styles to tables 
on pages 250, 337-340.</p>
