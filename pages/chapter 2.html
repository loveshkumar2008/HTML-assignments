<p><h5>Heading tag</h5>
HTML has six "levels" of 
headings:
h1 is used for main headings
h2 is used for subheadings
If there are further sections 
under the subheadings then the 
h3 element is used, and so 
on..</p><p><h5>Paragraph tag</h5>p To create a paragraph, surround 
the words that make up the 
paragraph with an opening p
tag and closing /p tag.
By default, a browser will show 
each paragraph on a new line 
with some space between it and 
any subsequent paragraphs.</p>
<h5>Bold</h5>
<p>By enclosing words in the tags 
b and /b we can make 
characters appear bold.
The b element also represents 
a section of text that would be 
presented in a visually different 
way (for example key words in a 
paragraph written in bold latters like:<b>My best friend</b>) although the use of 
the b element does not imply 
any additional meaning.</p>
<h5>italic</h5>
<p>By enclosing words in the tags 
i and /i we can make 
characters appear italic.
The i element also represents 
a section of text that would be 
said in a different way from 
surrounding content — such as 
technical terms, names of ships, 
foreign words, thoughts, or other 
terms that would usually be 
italicized. like this:<i>The Alchemist</i></p>
<h5>Superscript</h5><p>The sup element is used 
to contain characters that 
should be superscript such 
as the suffixes of dates or 
mathematical concepts like 
raising a number to a power such 
as 2<sup>2</sup>
.
</p>
<h5>subscript</h5><p>The sub element is used to 
contain characters that should 
be subscript. It is commonly 
used with foot notes or chemical 
formulas such as H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>
<h5>White space rule</h5>
<p>In order to make code easier to 
read, web page authors often 
add extra spaces or start some 
elements on new lines.
When the browser comes across 
two or more spaces next to each 
other, it only displays one space. 
Similarly if it comes across a line 
break, it treats that as a single 
space too. This is known as 
white space collapsing.
You will often see that web page 
authors take advantage of white 
space collapsing to indent their 
code in order to make it easier 
to follow.<p>
<h5>Line breaks</h5><p>In order to make code easier to 
read, web page authors often 
add extra spaces or start some 
elements on new lines.
When the browser comes across 
two or more spaces next to each 
other, it only displays one space. 
Similarly if it comes across a line 
break, it treats that as a single 
space too. This is known as 
white space collapsing.
You will often see that web page 
authors take advantage of white 
space collapsing to indent their 
code in order to make it easier 
to follow.</br></p>
<h5>Horizontal rule</h5>
<p>To create a break between 
themes — such as a change of 
topic in a book or a new scene 
in a play — you can add a 
horizontal rule between sections 
using the hr / tag as used bellow <hr/></p>
<h5>Strong tag</h5><p>The use of the strong
element indicates that its 
content has strong importance. 
For example, the words 
contained in this element might 
be said with strong emphasis.
By default, browsers will show 
the contents of a strong
element in bold. its used as:<p><strong>Beware:</strong> Pickpockets operate in 
 this area.</p></p>
<h5>emphasise</h5><p>The em element indicates 
emphasis that subtly changes 
the meaning of a sentence.
By default browsers will show 
the contents of an em element 
in italic. as done bellow:<p>I think <em>Ali</em> was the first.</p></p>
<h5>Blockquote</h5>
<p>The Blockquote element is 
used for longer quotes that take 
up an entire paragraph. Note 
how the p element is still 
used inside the blockquote
element. 
Browsers tend to indent the 
contents of the blockquote
element, however you should not 
use this element just to indent a 
piece of text — rather you should 
achieve this effect using CSS. <blockquote cite="https://www.google.com/search?q=quotes&rlz=1C1UEAD_enPK1068PK1068&oq=quotes&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyDAgAEEUYORixAxiABDIKCAEQABixAxiABDIKCAIQABixAxiABDIKCAMQABixAxiABDIHCAQQABiABDIGCAUQABgDMg0IBhAAGIMBGLEDGIAEMgcIBxAAGIAEMgcICBAAGI8CMgcICRAAGI8C0gEIMjYxN2owajeoAgCwAgA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">You must be the change you wish to see in the world.</p>

<h5>Quote</h5>
<p><q>The only thing we have to fear is fear itself. </q></p>
<h5>Abberiviation</h5>
<p>If you use an abbreviation or 
an acronym, then the abbr
element can be used. A title
attribute on the opening tag is 
used to specify the full term.eg:<abbr title="Doctor">Dr.</abbr></p>
<h5>Acronym</h5>
<p>In HTML 4 there was a separate 
acronym element for 
acronyms. To spell out the full 
form of the acronym, the title
attribute was used (as with the 
abbr element above). HTML5 
just uses the <abbr> element 
for both abbreviations and 
acronyms.eg:<acronym title="Lahore university of management science">LUMS</acronym></p>
<h5>Cite</h5>
<p>When you are referencing a 
piece of work such as a book, 
film or research paper, the 
<cite> element can be used 
to indicate where the citation is 
from . eg:<cite>The Alchemist</cite>by paulo couhlo</p>
<h5>Define</h5>
<p>The first time you explain some 
new terminology (perhaps an 
academic concept or some 
jargon) in a document, it is 
known as the defining instance 
of it eg:<br/><dfn>Biology</dfn> is the branch of science which deals with the study of living organisms.</p>
<h5>Author Details</h5>
<p>The address element has 
quite a specific use: to contain 
contact details for the author of 
the page.
It can contain a physical address, 
but it does not have to. For 
example, it may also contain a 
phone number or email address.
Browsers often display the 
content of the address
element in italics.
You may also be interested in 
something called the hCard 
microformat for adding physical 
address information to your 
markup.as used bellow:<adress><a href="mailto:loveshsarwan@gamil.com">For contact:</a></adress></p>
<h5>Changes to content</h5>
<p>The ins element can be used 
to show content that has been 
inserted into a document, while 
the del element can show text 
that has been deleted from it.
The content of a ins element 
is usually underlined, while the 
content of a del element 
usually has a line through it.eg:They <del> is</del><ins> are</ins> playing cricket.</p>
