<h1 id="link2">Links</h1>
<p>Links are the defining feature of the web 
because they allow you to move from 
one web page to another â€” enabling the 
very idea of browsing or surfing.</p>
<p>You will commonly come across the following types of links<ul><li>Links from one website to another</li><li>Links from one page to another on the same website</li><li>Links from one part of a web page to another part of the 
same page</li><li>Links that open in a new browser window</li><li>Links that start up your email program and address a new 
email to someone
</li></ul></p>
<h4>Linking to other sites</h4>
<p>Links are created using the .a.
element which has an attribute 
called href. The value of the 
href attribute is the page that 
you want people to go to when 
they click on the link.
Users can click on anything that 
appears between the opening 
<a> tag and the closing ./a.
tag and will be taken to the page 
specified in the href attribute.
When you link to a different 
website, the value of the href
attribute will be the full web 
address for the site, which is 
known as an absolute URL.
Browsers show links in blue with 
an underline by default.eg:<a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/589690144987527300/">Lord kirshna painting<a>
</p>
<h4>Linking to Other Pages on the Same Site</h4>
<p>When you are linking to other 
pages within the same site, 
you do not need to specify the 
domain name in the URL. You 
can use a shorthand known as a 
relative URL.
If all the pages of the site are in 
the same folder, then the value 
of the href attribute is just the 
name of the file.
If you have different pages of a 
site in different folders, then you 
can use a slightly more complex 
syntax to indicate where the 
page is in relation to the current 
page. You will learn more about 
these on the pages 81-84.
If you look at the download 
code for each chapter, you will 
see that the index.html file 
contains links that use relative 
URLs.
eg:
<ol><li><a href="chapter 1.html">structure</a></li>
<li><a href="chapter 2.html">text</a></li>
<li><a href="chapter 3.html">lists</a></li>
<li><a href="chapter 4.html">links</a></li></ol>
</p>
<h4>Email links</h4>
<p>To create a link that starts up 
the user's email program and 
addresses an email to a specified 
email address, you use the <a>
element. However, this time the 
value of the href attribute starts 
with mailto: and is followed by 
the email address you want the 
email to be sent to.
On the right you can see that 
an email link looks just like any 
other link but, when it is clicked 
on, the user's email program 
will open a new email message 
and address it to the person 
specified in the link.eg:<a href="mailto:loveshsarwan@gmail.com">Here is my email</a></p>
<h4>Opening Links in
a New Window
</h4>
<p>If you want a link to open in a 
new window, you can use the 
target attribute on the opening 
<a> tag. The value of this 
attribute should be _blank.
One of the most common 
reasons a web page author 
might want a link to be opened 
in a new window is if it points to 
another website. In such cases, 
they hope the user will return 
to the window containing their 
site after finishing looking at the 
other one.eg:<a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/589690144987527300/" target="_blank">Lord kirshna painting</a></p>
<h4>Linking to a Specific 
Part of the Same Page
</h4>
<p>At the top of a long page 
you might want to add a list 
of contents that links to the 
corresponding sections lower 
down. Or you might want to add 
a link from part way down the 
page back to the top of it to save 
users from having to scroll back 
to the top.
Before you can link to a specific 
part of a page, you need to 
identify the points in the page 
that the link will go to. You do 
this using the id attribute (which 
can be used on every HTML 
element). You can see that the 
h1 and h2 elements in this 
example have been given id
attributes that identify those 
sections of the page.
The value of the id attribute 
should start with a letter or an 
underscore (not a number or 
any other character) and, on a 
single page, no two id attributes 
should have the same value.
To link to an element that uses 
an id attribute you use the a
element again, but the value of 
the href attribute starts with 
the # symbol, followed by the 
value of the id attribute of the 
element you want to link to. In 
this example, a href="#top"
links to the h1 element at 
the top of the page whose id
attribute has a value of top.like as:<a href="#link2"> links starting</a></p>
<h4>Linking to a Specific 
Part of the another Page
</h4>
<p>If you want to link to a specific 
part of a different page (whether 
on your own site or a different 
website) you can use a similar 
technique.
As long as the page you are 
linking to has id attributes that 
identify specific parts of the 
page, you can simply add the 
same syntax to the end of the 
link for that page.
Therefore, the href attribute 
will contain the address for the 
page (either an absolute URL or 
a relative URL), followed by the 
# symbol, followed by the value 
of the id attribute that is used on 
the element you are linking to.
For example, to link to the 
bottom of the homepage of the 
website that accompanies this 
book, you would write:
a href="http:/www.
htmlandcssbookcom/
#bottom" for example:<a href="./chapter 2.html/#bottom"</a></p>
</body>
<a href="../home page.html">home page</a>
